This study seeks to examine the influence of unequal resource distribution, represented by sugar patches, on the final population in the two neighboring cities with similar demographics (similar initial population, vision & metabolism). This analysis is conducted by analyzing data generated from Behavior Space and subsequently exploring the consequences of equal & unequal sugar scenarios on the behavior of the "Sugarscape-1" and "Sugarscape-2" models. More specifically, we aim to assess the effects of different resource availability in these two adjacent cities, comparing the behaviors of agents within each model as well as across the different models.
